# krylov-method
A method for finding eigenvalues of a given matrix

The method is described in the book by I.S. Berezin, N.P. Zhidkov "Computing Methods", Volume 2.

There are also two experiments on matrix norm inequalities.

## Build and run

You must have the latest versions of clang, cmake and ninja installed on your system. The Eigen library is also required for building.

The easiest way to build, run and modify is via vscode. You must install CMakeTools and clangd extensions.

Or, you can just simply run `buildnrun.sh` and use your favorite editor.
